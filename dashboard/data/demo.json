{"text": "Hit up the handy yelp app when trying to decide on a southside place to get some good food at the last moment on a Saturday.  This place popped up and was open so we headed over to it.\nRight off the bat, as I was visualizing the location via the address, I mentioned to my wife that this might be kinda off the beaten path - and turns out I was dead on.  Being around 6 on a dark winter Saturday night, we found ourselves driving through an abandoned industrial wasteland.  The streets were lined with closed warehouses and factories without a soul in site - complete darkness as everything was obviously closed.  As we approached the address, sure enough there was a tiny bit of light breaking through the dark.  Yup, this place is completely hidden - you won't accidentally stumble upon it at night unless you are the type to just drive around industrial areas after closing (and hey, I'm not judging).  Seriously, there is NOTHING around here, but this little gem.\nWe got there just after 6ish and there was one table filled with folks and a lot of empty tables.\nThe super friendly staff quickly sat us and let us go through the menu.  Each table has a little button to press when you are ready to order or need some assistance - this was pretty cool.\nNow the food - all I can say is WOW!  First off, the servings are HUGE(!!!!).  WE ordered a couple of menu items that had \"(2)\" next to them, which I assumed meant that the plate is for two people to share - but when they hauled these out to us each was enough for a quartet do dine on....and oh so tasty!\nWe had a plate of glass noodles with shrimp and all kinds of veggies, and another plate of chicken with a kinda hot but sweet sauce, and both were so good....and soooo much.  Needless to say, we ended up taking a large amount home for a complete other meal the next day.\nWe ended up leaving just before 8:00pm and the place had slowly filled up by the time we left - I was amazed that this many people would venture into such and isolated location for a meal, but having enjoyed a feast there, I can now see why.\nOh, and the best part was when they set a pair of scissors down on the table before the meal (along with a large variety of sides to go with the meal).  I asked what this was for (perhaps there was something about a free haircut on the menu that i missed!?!) and the waiter just smiled and said it would be obvious.  Of course, we then saw the other folks using the shears to cut the long noodles as they served themselves....duh.

Here are a few highlights:  \n\nService: Amy Bardales is an incredibly gracious and organized manager. We live in Chicago so we had to rely on her for many details with the decor, layout, etc. In my opinion, she went above and beyond what a typical venue manager would help with. Throughout the entire process, she was incredibly responsive and thorough when responding to questions over email/phone, which helped calm our pre-wedding jitters. The day of the wedding, she and her staff were so accommodating and made everyone feel at home. Our families and friends all had great things to say about their experience. \n\nSpace: This is the place if you're looking for a festive and authentic French Quarter feel for an event. We were a tiny bit nervous at first about having our ceremony on Bourbon Street, but the courtyard is secluded and set back far from the street. There are also a couple nice rooms connected to the courtyard- we had a photobooth in one and extra tables and chairs in the other. The banquet room on the second level is beautiful and has a huge balcony overlooking Bourbon- our guests loved standing out there and taking in the scene. We had about 140 guests and it was more than enough space for people to move around between the inside/outside areas. \n\nValue: We did a lot of research and saw quite a few other venues, and 530 Bourbon is a great value overall. The bar packages are reasonable and include better brands for the price than usual. If you're not a natural at event planning, the peace of mind you get working with Amy and her team is worth every penny.  \n\nThanks again Amy and crew!", "cool": 0, "funny": 0, "useful": 0, "business_name": "Five Thirty Bourbon"}

My favorite was the spicy girl roll, which leans to the higher end price for sushi at $17, but it was definitely delicious. Most things are reasonably priced which is always nice with a sushi restaurant where prices can sometimes get out of hand. We went during happy hour but wanted to sit at a table so we weren't allowed to get happy hour deals. You MUST sit at the bar (the drink bar not the sushi bar) which I think is kind of silly because most people don't go to a sushi restaurant to drink. I ordered vanilla Mochi balls for dessert, which are my favorite, but was greatly disappointed when they came out.

He stopped by several times before our entrees were delivered to check in on us, refill drinks, and just ensure we were doing ok.  I absolutely loved this.  It was been such a long time since we've had this kind of service.  Used to service where the waiter/waitress disappears and you have to wait a long time to get their attention or they only arrive when it's necessary.  When our entrees arrived, we noticed we needed more sauce on my hubs pasta as there was very little on it.  So we asked Collin which he promptly got on that and brought a small dish out once it was heated.  He was certain to explain to us that it would take a bit of time since they had to heat the sauce, which was ok.\n\nTonight I felt spoiled, I felt the center of Collins attention and he was like that w/every one of his tables.  He was also very courteous and delightful.  I think when we visit more we'll be asking to sit in his area, if he's working. BIG kudos to Collin!

{"text": "My husband just returned with dinner for our family, and he warned us that all three of our gyro salads might lack vegetables because the young woman told him that they ran out of them. When we opened our salads, I noticed the lettuce appeared wilted with a lot of hard pieces and only included black olives and tomatoes with a skimpy portion of dried out gyro meat. \n\nWe were so hungry, and by the time we tried to call them back to complain, we couldn't reach anyone because it was already past 8:00 p.m. We attempted to eat our meals out of desperation, but they were just pitiful and did not taste like the gyro salads that we had purchased in the past from here. My stepdaughter even said the salad tasted funny and stopped eating it.\n\nIf they were running out of vegetables, and since a salad consists of vegetables, the apathetic young woman could have informed my husband that when he placed our order. We would have ordered something else or went elsewhere.\n\nWe barely ate our salads, and after realizing we weren't going to reach anyone since they were now closed, my husband had to step out and buy a second dinner for all of us at Arby's, which will probably be of much higher quality than the pathetic gyro salads from this place. \n\nWe deserve our money back, but I'm sure we won't get it. If not, we will never be back or recommend this place to anyone. Excellent customer service goes a long way, and this place severely lacks just that unfortunately. If I could have given an accurate rating, I would have left zero stars for the non-existent customer service and awful food. \n\nThere are too many wonderful non-chain food  establishments in this city to waste any more of our money on the trash that we received as \"food\" tonight from this joint.

The guys really know what they are doing, they do it right, and they do it the first time. \nMoonbeam (the BMW) and Rommel (the Benz) are the typical German cars wherein components change whenever the engineers feel like changing them, so everything relies on the suppliers knowing the VINs to get the parts right. There's a California supplier of fancy - drilled and slotted - brake rotors that Moonbeam and Rommel really like. Never a problem. \nEnter Hank, the Ford Ranger. Fords are Fords, right? Nope. Seems like manual transmission Rangers, accounting for less than 10% of the output, are Unicorns. Even the Californian rotor manufacturer did not know that the manual Rangers need a very different rotor. The fancy rotors mechanically fit perfectly, but the \"tone ring\" for the ABS confused the sensors. The guys at Mr. Tire instantly diagnosed the problem and set about special-ordering the right ones. We've changed the Ranger's name from Hank to Unicorn, the rare beast which never conforms to expectations.

We all love the outdoor seating and decor that they offer, and never complain about a place that welcomes our fury friends! Another big reason we love Three Birds Tavern is due to their extensive menu, offering something for everyone and options for all dietary restrictions and needs. For starters, we have tried their Roasted Shishito Peppers, Wings, JoJos (roasted potato wedges), Scotch Egg and more. Personally, I love their Shishito Peppers. They are very uniquely done here with a delicious citrus pesto. For sandwiches, we have tried their BLT which is always the go to for one of my co-workers, talk about a lot of bacon!!! Their Chicken Salad sandwich never disappoints either! I love the variety of salads that they offer, never plain or boring and always come with lots of toppings! If you like spicy, definitely try their Buffalo Chicken Salad, so yummy! Three Birds is a great restaurant on 4th Ave and one I highly recommend trying out! \n\nI also have to note how they are giving back to the community currently with the C-Virus.

{"text": "My girlfriend and I wandered in because the sign said it was new so we wanted to check it out.  It took them awhile to seat us but no big deal.  Our server Ciara, was brand new but she was very friendly and attentive.  Mgmt didn't seem to make her life very easy.  I will explain a little later.  We ordered the guacamole ($6.25) it was delicious but the serving was much too small for the price.  For dinner we had the California Burrito (7.95) and the Taco salad ($12.50).  The food was pretty good.  The chef even came out to ask us how our meal was.  Drink specials were $2.00 margaritas.  The margaritas were ok but you can't complain when your only paying $2.  Experience was going pretty good until it was time to pay the check.  Our server Ciara, proceeded to tell us that the credit card machine was down and that she needed to walk us to the atm machine to get cash.  We were frustrated but she seemed very apologetic so we didn't give her a hard time.  She offered to make things right by giving us a round of shots from the bar.  This didn't seem to make the \"manager\" very happy but she said that it was the right thing to do.  So we took our shots and proceeded to make the 10 min walk to the ATM machine.  Now I must say, I was very upset that this \"manager\" made a young woman walk with 2 complete strangers at night to an ATM machine.  It just doesn't seem safe and very inappropriate.  In addition to that, he didn't even come himself to apologize or explain what happened.  You would think a new restaurant they would make sure that customer service was on point.  When we got back, we asked to speak to the \"manager\".  We explained to him that Ciara was a great server and that the ONLY reason we would come back would be for her.  He said nothing!  No sorry, no thank you for coming, nothing....instead he looked annoyed that we were bothering him.  That just made me sad.  So, if anyone at Tequilas is reading this, your \"management staff\" needs a lesson on how to be an effective, appropriate manager and you might want to reconsider your policy on forcing your staff to walk out with your customers in Ybor City under any circumstance.  It's just plain dangerous.  Kudos to the chef for a good meal and Ciara for doing an awesome job on her first day!!", "cool": 1, "funny": 0, "useful": 2, "business_name": "Tequilas"}

{"text": "O'Connell's used to be my favorite place in town to get a burger. While so many restaurants push over-seasoned burgers loaded up with onion rings and bacon in order to distract from the fact that they are sub par, O'Connell's became my favorite because they did just the opposite. Simple menu, no bullshit, just huge juicy burgers cooked perfectly to order. \n\nThen something went really wrong. I went there one night and received a medium well burger (I'd ordered it rare) with no flavor or juiciness. I chalked it up to a bad night; not a big deal. I told the waitress I was disappointed, she agreed that the burger looked overcooked, and she took it off my bill. Then I went back again and had the exact same experience. I started to realize it was more than just being overcooked - the quality of the meat tasted different, not as good, like there was filler or something. The final straw was the middle of February, when I went with my parents, who also love O'Connell's burgers. We all left disappointed.

She was helpful and attentive. No issue here. \n\nFood 4 stars - it's bar food but pretty darn good. I consider it above average. I had the trio sliders.

Really well done. \n\nValue 3 Stars - for basically two appetizers and four beers we left with a $60 bill. Alittle high for what you get but considering it is in the heart of broadway, probably pretty typical. \n\nAll in all, it was ok. I would give it 3.5 but yelp won't allow me to do that.

I strongly didn't believe what I was told because when I asked, the girl gave me a look like she knew that I wouldn't be accommodated but she still asked someone was there anymore chicken and the guy immediately said no but it was in a way that showed he just didn't want to cut any or grill any. Extremely disappointing as me and my friends had really wanted Felipe's. I had ordered 5 chicken quesadillas but had to cancel one of them because I refused to eat dry chicken. My friends still got their's as they were really hungry and didn't want to go some place else. I went to Five Guy's next door where I was guaranteed hot, fresh food. Not food that had been sitting.

The service at the bar is another issue, or should I say non-service.  I've been to Siberia probably a dozen times, and the service has been adequate, but there's one woman who's served me maybe 3-4 times . . . she can be personable, but the first time I saw her, she neglected to tell me until after I was finished, about a Polish vodka that was on the happy hour menu, and I ended up buying expensive shots for more than I wanted to pay.  My fault for not asking, I suppose.  The last time I encountered her, I met my buddy at the bar, and he'd been sitting there for a few minutes with a dirty food dish right in front of him, and I asked him if he'd just eaten, and he says no, that's been here for a while.  Meanwhile the bartenderess is 4 feet away from us, chatting away with her girlfriends, she hasn't taken my friend's drink order, and he's getting increasingly annoyed with the situation, as he is a professional bartender and knows bad service when he sees it.  I can tell he's thinking about splitting (and he likes this place too, we usually go there together), or at least moving to another part of the joint.  So he asks her, \"Are you going to be bartending here all night?\" or something like that, and she says, \"I'll be here for another half hour or hour\", and so he just gets up and walks towards the backroom where people can get away from the noise from the overly loud bands that play on the stage every night.  So we go back there, but I still have to get us a couple of drinks, and I return to the bar to order, and it's the same thing all over with the B-ess blathering away with her sisters about their personal issues, while I stand there for at least a couple of minutes.  I finally have to yell over to her, Hey, can I order something here?  She  looks annoyed, comes over, and asks what I want.  I order bourbon and water for my friend, and Czech beer for myself, plus I want a shot of some kind of Polish or Russian vodka, but she is committed to giving me as little information as possible, \"what do you want\" she says, and I say \"what do you have?\", and she just gestures over to the bar to the scores of bottles and says \"that\".  I finally get her to tell me the names of 2 or 3, and I order one.  I normally tip for adequate/good service, which I believe is why anyone tips, so I pay my $16 (decent price) and probably should have left her nothing, but did give her $1, to which she say in a sneering tone of voice, \"Oh, THANKS for the tip\" and I reply \"Well, thanks for the GOOD service!\" . . . . I'll never go there again if she's working, cause she'd probably spit in my drink when she thinks I'm not looking.

I go in yesterday 5 months later (no call ever) and now they told me they recycled the phone and called me back. I was on the phone with the husband  who was confrontational and a self proclaimed business guru who has a lawyer on retainer (we all know what that means when a small business proclaims that) Also if a 600 square foot cell phone repair shop has to keep a lawyer on retainer thats a major red flag...lol. Nowhere on my receipt and F&Q does it state that phones will be recycled in a certain time period, so that being his main point holds no validity. The best part is that he insisted that I should have been calling them and stopping in the store when I was told to what for a phone call... What part of customer service is lost in translation...I am the customer and it is there job to keep me informed...Customer Service 101. Or since they know me they could of called before they recycled but I guess giving someone a phone call is an issue at this front. Then he proceeds to tell me there is a State Law that puts a time frame on recycling cell phones...Lie again, it states  that these phones have to be recycled at a specific place, and they still get money for valuable metals in the phone. I was considering legal action, but I don't want to have to deal with Saul Goodman...

On a recent trip with the family, we decided to book rooms at the Thompson because of its central location and its reviews. \n\nThe rooms: the rooms do not have carpeting and feel hard and cold. Bring your slippers.  As for the hotel's slippers provided, they are good if you wear a size 10, not if you wear a few sizes smaller. \n\nThe lighting: the rooms are too dark to get any meaningful work done in the evenings. We had to ask for a desk lamp, which had to be scened into the desk. Felt like a dorm desk lamp. \n\nThe bed: comfortable but the pillows were not comfortable. I woke up with a stiff back. The walls are thin so I could hear noise from next door and the elevator all night. \n\nOutlets:  not enough outlets. I tried to plug in my hairdryer where the long mirror is but there were no outlets there. There need to be more outlets so I don't have to dry my hair in the foggy bathroom. \n\nThe bathroom: there are no shelves or drawers for your toiletries. There is also no fan. Not good, especially in a city with rain and lots of humidity. The decor is attractive, but I feel as if they have cut corners.  The bathroom windows took forever to lift the fog.  The bathroom door has a glass panel so when you turn the light on, everyone wakes up. There is also a loud latch that is noisy when trying to keep the door shut. The towels are also up too high to reach.  I also wonder why there is no bath tub, when that seems standard at most hotels. The water pressure is also fairly weak, even on the strongest setting. \n\nFood:  food was fine but I had a sick child and asked for some plain broth. The kitchen was closed. No food...?  We ultimately had to ride the elevator up to the 3rd floor to get bar food (only). There, we walked into a loud, rowdy bar filled with drunk women.  \n\nI would try other 5 stars the next time I visit. The rooms look \"picture-worthy\" but don't match up in person.

{"text": "Hidden Gem just outside of Reno Airport. I recently made a trip to Nevada to pick up my Grandkids. I took an early flight and wanted to grab breakfast before my hour drive to get them. Yelp pointed me to Kaffe Crepe. It is a small place with a nice selection of both sweet and savory crepes. Nothing fancy, but the crepes were delicious and the service was fantastic. I had the bacon and egg breakfast crepe and a cappuccino. Both were marvelous. My only very minor issue was that they only had paper cups and plastic silverware but I understand. The food and service were so good that I brought my Granddaughters back there on our way back to the airport later that same day. They had never had crepes. They loved watching the crepes being made. The owner and the woman working the register treated the girls like royalty. They were so nice and made it a fun experience for the kids. The Biscoff cookie butter and strawberry crepe was to die for. The strawberry cheesecake crepe was also excellent. Check out Kaffe Crepe if you're ever in the area. It is right near Costco so a great detour on a Costco trip.", "cool": 0, "funny": 0, "useful": 0, "business_name": "Kaffe Crepe"}

{"text": "Dr. Copeland is awesome.  I hadn't been to a dentist in a long time and eventually broke a tooth and was forced to go in as a new patient.  I was nervous, but everyone was so friendly and understanding.  I needed multiple visits to take care of multiple issues, and doing more than what I went in for was all 100% my choice.  Nobody pressured me into a thing.  If you haven't been to a dentist in a long time, you really can't be too surprised if there's more than one thing the dentist is going to recommend you take care of... that's their job.  I'm glad she said something about the issues aside from what I went in for, had she not, I'd probably be in there months from now with a bill twice as expensive.  They're great and on top of everyone being friendly, I've never felt a thing during any of my procedures.", "cool": 0, "funny": 0, "useful": 0, "business_name": "Catalina Smiles Dentistry"}
{"text": "Ok.  I absolutely love Top Golf.  The only thing I don't love is the drive to Brandon.  I love that they marry golfing with a scoring system similar to bowling.  My last outing it was for a friends birthday.  They had only reserved one bay and about 30 people showed up.  I really need to say the staff was awesome and were able to accommodate us.  They put us between two groups that had been there for a while.  So as soon as the booth the first one about 15 minutes and the second about 30 they sat 6 more of of group.  We had a server just for our group.  I really liked the fact that even though we were split up we still had a fantastic time. The music they played wasn't so loud we couldn't talk but just loud enough to have us singing and dancing along while waiting for our turn. I did order the chimichurri hummus it was good.  There wasn't as much chimichurri flavor I would have liked but I still love hummus.  So it was good.  \nI will probably be back here because this is a great place to meet with friends.", "cool": 3, "funny": 1, "useful": 4, "business_name": "Topgolf"}
